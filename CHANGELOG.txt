v2.0.0 (2021/04/26)	 
===================

This release is not backward compatible.

- remove the manual memory management. There is no need to destroy the KIM-API objects in Python explicitly. By using smart pointers with custom deleters, Python controls the ownership of newly created objects, and the garbage collector module is tracking their status.
- the interface is updated, and no error message returns from the KIM-API to the users. It throws a RuntimeError exception with a print indicating what went wrong in case of an error.
- input and return arguments are now in lower case.
- methods are provided with a docstring explaining the purpose. 
- NeighList module is updated. One uses NeighList() class to create an instance of the NeighList object and calls its methods.


v0.3.3 (2019/10/28)
==================

- update setup.py to not explicitly use `pip` and `python`

- remove pybind11==2.2.3 version dependence, since the `get_include()` of
  pybind11 is fixed
